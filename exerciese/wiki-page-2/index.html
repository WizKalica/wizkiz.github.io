              whose activity consists in projecting visual 
            communications intended to transmit specific messages to social groups, 
            with specific objectives.
            <sup>[6]</sup> 
            Graphic design is an interdisciplinary 
            branch of design
            <sup>[1]</sup>
             and of the fine arts. Its practice involves creativity,
            innovation and lateral thinking using manual or digital tools,
            where it is usual to use text and graphics to communicate visually.
        </p>
           
            The role of the graphic designer in the communication process is that of encoder or 
            interpreter of the message.
            They work on the interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages. 
            Usually, graphic design uses the aesthetics of typography and the compositional
            arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery to convey ideas, feelings,
            and attitudes beyond what language alone expresses. The design work can be based on 
            a customer's demand, a demand that ends up being established linguistically, 
            either orally or in writing, that is, that graphic design transforms a linguistic message 
            into a graphic manifestation.[7]
            Graphic design has, as a field of application, 
            different areas of knowledge focused on any visual communication system.
             For example, it can be applied in advertising strategies, 
            or it can also be applied in the aviation world[8] 
            or space exploration.[9][10] In this sense, in some countries graphic 
            design is related as only associated with the production of sketches
            and drawings, this is incorrect, since visual communication is a small part
            of a huge range of types and classes where it can be applied.

            With origins in Antiquity and the Middle Ages,
            <sup>[11]</sup>
            graphic design as applied art was initially linked to 
            the boom of rise of printing in Europe in the 15th century 
            and the growth of consumer culture in the Industrial Revolution. 
            From there it emerged as a distinct profession in the West, 
            closely associated with advertising in the 19th century
            <sup>[12]</sup>
            and its evolution allowed its consolidation in the 20th century.
            Given the rapid and massive growth in information exchange today,
            the demand for experienced designers is greater than ever, particularly
            because of the development of new technologies and the need to pay 
            attention to human factors beyond the competence of the engineers 
            who develop them.

                William Addison Dwiggins is often credited with first using the
                term "graphic design" in a 1922 article,[14] although it 
                appears in a 4 July 1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of 
                Organized Labor, a publication of the Labor Unions of San 
                Francisco, in an article about technical education for printers:[15]

                An Enterprising Trades Union
                … The admittedly high standard of intelligence which prevails among
                 printers is an assurance that with the elemental principles of design 
                 at their finger ends many of them will grow in knowledge and develop 
                 into specialists in graphic design and decorating. …
