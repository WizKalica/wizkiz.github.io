            <p>Mortal Kombat 1 is a 2023 fighting game developed by NetherRealm Studios 
                and published by Warner Bros. Games. It is the twelfth main installment 
                in the Mortal Kombat series, and serves as its second reboot after 2011's 
                Mortal Kombat (2011). The game was released on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, 
                Windows, and Xbox Series X/S on September 19, 2023.

                In addition to being a reboot, the game is also a sequel to 2019's Mortal 
                Kombat 11, taking place in a new timeline directly created by Liu Kang in
                 his ending of 11's Aftermath expansion.[5] In this new timeline, Fire God 
                 Liu Kang assembles a clique of fighters to participate in the latest Mortal
                  Kombat tournament set in Outworld, while coming into a conflict with an alliance 
                  of two individuals (the Shang Tsung and Quan Chi of Liu's timeline) trained by 
                  Titan Shang Tsung.
                 Mortal Kombat 1 received generally positive reviews from critics, except for the Nintendo 
                 Switch version, which was criticized for its graphics and technical issues.

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>
                    Mortal Kombat 1 features a story mode, online multiplayer with rollback netcode,
                     and offline gameplay. The game introduces a feature called Kameo Fighters,
                      which provides assistance to the player during fights in a similar fashion to 
                      the tag assist fighters of the Towers of Time mode in Mortal Kombat 11 (2019)
                       These characters are separate from the main roster and are chosen before each 
                       fight. There are two types of assists provided by each Kameo Fighter: 
                    Summons, which can be performed while the player remains in one place, 
                    and Ambushes, which can be performed regardless of what the player is doing. 
                    They can also be called to perform their own Fatalities and Brutalities.
                    In addition, the chosen Kameo Fighter also affects how much health the 
                    players will have in a fight.[6][7]
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Fatal Blows, first introduced in Mortal Kombat 11, returns with different functionality. 
                    These special moves can still be triggered when a player's health drops below 30% only,
                     however in this game, they are performed as collaborative offensive moves between a 
                     player and a Kameo Fighter, with each delivering an attack in tandem. Additionally, 
                     the most significant attack performed during the Fatal Blow features the X-Ray effects 
                     seen in Mortal Kombat X (2015).[8] Also returning is the Air Kombat combo system which 
                     was featured in both Mortal 
                    Kombat: Armageddon (2006) and the action spin-off Shaolin Monks (2005).[9]

                    For single-player, the game features the return of the plot-driven Story 
                    Mode and the traditional form of Towers mode from the previous games, while 
                    introducing the addition of the seasonal Invasion mode, an online mode combining 
                    fighting mechanics with board game and role-playing game elements.[10] The players 
                    are tasked to move around the board while completing various challenges on each 
                    space they move to, earning rewards such as skins, in-game currency, or concept 
                    art for completing the challenges. Each Invasion season lasts around six weeks 
                    and has its own board and theme.[11] For multiplayer, the versus modes include 
                    Local mode to play a match on the same console, Online mode to play against 
                    opponents all over the world, and Tournament
                     mode to host a tournament with a unified rule set for the matches.[10]

                     skin for Johnny Cage featuring the likeness and voice of Jean-Claude Van Damme.[9]
                     Kameo Fighters are a unique roster of partner characters to assist during matches,

                        characters are chosen separately from the main roster of fighters.[9] Some 
                        characters can serve as both Kameo Fighters and main roster fighters. Guest 
                        characters can even serve as Kameo Fighters.[12]

                     and Xbox Series X/S would receive access to a beta in August, and after the game launches, NetherRealm Studios

                     cross-play and cross-progression.[16] The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of the game were 
                     developed by NetherRealm 
                     Studios, the Windows version by QLOC, and the Nintendo Switch version by Shiver Entertainment and Saber
