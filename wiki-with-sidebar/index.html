            The 100 is an American post-apocalyptic science 
            fiction drama television series that premiered on March 19,
             2014, on The CW, and ended on September 30, 2020. Developed 
             by Jason Rothenberg, the series is loosely based on the young 
             adult novel series of the same name by Kass Morgan. The 100 
             follows post-apocalyptic survivors from a space habitat, the Ark,
             who return to Earth nearly a century after a devastating nuclear
             apocalypse. The first people sent to Earth are a group of juvenile
             delinquents who encounter descendants of survivors of the nuclear
             disaster on the ground.
             The juvenile delinquents include Clarke Griffin (Eliza Taylor), 
             Finn Collins (Thomas McDonell), Bellamy Blake (Bob Morley), Octavia Blake
             (Marie Avgeropoulos), Jasper Jordan (Devon Bostick), Monty Green 
             (Christopher Larkin), and John Murphy (Richard Harmon). Other 
             lead characters include Clarke's mother Dr. Abby Griffin (Paige Turco),
             Marcus Kane (Henry Ian Cusick), and Chancellor Thelonious Jaha 
             (Isaiah Washington), all of whom are council members on the Ark,
             and Raven Reyes (Lindsey Morgan), a mechanic aboard the Ark.

            <p> 

            Set in 2149, 97 years after a nuclear apocalypse has devastated the surface of Earth, the only survivors were approximately 400 inhabitants of 12 national space stations that were in orbit at the time. Three generations have survived in space. The Ark has strict measures, including capital punishment for those over 18 and population control, as the leaders of the Ark take steps to ensure the survival of the human race. But now, resources are running out and the Ark is dying. For the first time in nearly a century, there is talk of returning to Earth.
            100 juveniles convicted of various crimes are sent to Earth to 
            see if it is survivable. Among them are 17-year-old Clarke Griffin, 
            the daughter of the Ark's chief medical officer and of the Ark's chief engineer; 
            Wells Jaha, the son of Chancellor Jaha; the daredevil Finn Collins; the illegal sister Octavia Blake; 
            her stowaway brother Bellamy Blake; the lighthearted Jasper Jordan; and the resourceful Monty Green.
            Technologically blind to what’s happening to the 100 on Earth, the Ark’s leaders Chancellor
             Jaha, second-in-command Marcus Kane, Councilwoman Abigail Griffin and the Council are faced
            with difficult decisions about life, death and the continued existence of the human race.
