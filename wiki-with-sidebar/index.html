        <i>Article</i>

        <p>
            The 100 is an American post-apocalyptic science 
            fiction drama television series that premiered on March 19,
             2014, on The CW, and ended on September 30, 2020. Developed 
             by Jason Rothenberg, the series is loosely based on the young 
             adult novel series of the same name by Kass Morgan. The 100 
             follows post-apocalyptic survivors from a space habitat, the Ark,
             who return to Earth nearly a century after a devastating nuclear
             apocalypse. The first people sent to Earth are a group of juvenile
             delinquents who encounter descendants of survivors of the nuclear
             disaster on the ground.
             The juvenile delinquents include Clarke Griffin (Eliza Taylor), 
             Finn Collins (Thomas McDonell), Bellamy Blake (Bob Morley), Octavia Blake
             (Marie Avgeropoulos), Jasper Jordan (Devon Bostick), Monty Green 
             (Christopher Larkin), and John Murphy (Richard Harmon). Other 
             lead characters include Clarke's mother Dr. Abby Griffin (Paige Turco),
             Marcus Kane (Henry Ian Cusick), and Chancellor Thelonious Jaha 
             (Isaiah Washington), all of whom are council members on the Ark,
             and Raven Reyes (Lindsey Morgan), a mechanic aboard the Ark.

        <h1>Plot</h1>
            <hr>
            <p> 

            Set in 2149, 97 years after a nuclear apocalypse has devastated the surface of Earth, the only survivors were approximately 400 inhabitants of 12 national space stations that were in orbit at the time. Three generations have survived in space. The Ark has strict measures, including capital punishment for those over 18 and population control, as the leaders of the Ark take steps to ensure the survival of the human race. But now, resources are running out and the Ark is dying. For the first time in nearly a century, there is talk of returning to Earth.
            100 juveniles convicted of various crimes are sent to Earth to 
            see if it is survivable. Among them are 17-year-old Clarke Griffin, 
            the daughter of the Ark's chief medical officer and of the Ark's chief engineer; 
            Wells Jaha, the son of Chancellor Jaha; the daredevil Finn Collins; the illegal sister Octavia Blake; 
            her stowaway brother Bellamy Blake; the lighthearted Jasper Jordan; and the resourceful Monty Green.
            Technologically blind to what’s happening to the 100 on Earth, the Ark’s leaders Chancellor
             Jaha, second-in-command Marcus Kane, Councilwoman Abigail Griffin and the Council are faced
            with difficult decisions about life, death and the continued existence of the human race.

        In the third season, Alpha Station, renamed Arkadia, comes under new management when Pike,
         a former teacher and mentor on the Ark, is elected as chancellor and begins a war with the 
         grounders. Pike kills an encampment of grounder warriors while they sleep, which further 
         damages their already fragile relationship with the grounders. Furthermore, the grounder 
         commander Lexa is killed by her mentor during a failed assassination attempt on Clarke, 
         with whom she was romantically involved. A.L.I.E. – who was commanded to make life better 
         for mankind – is revealed to have responded to the problem of human overpopulation by 
         launching the nuclear apocalypse that devastated Earth, and begins to use ingestible computer
          chips to take control of peoples' minds. A.L.I.E.
         is ultimately destroyed by Clarke, but not before warning of another 
         impending apocalyptic disaster.

    <h1>Production</h1>
    <hr>
    <h4>Filming</h4>
    <p>
        Filming for the series takes place in and around Vancouver, 
        British Columbia, Canada. Production on the pilot occurred during the 
        second quarter of 2013. After the show received a series order,
        filming occurred for the first season between August 2013 and January 2014.
        Filming for the second season commenced on July 7, 2014, and concluded on
        January 23, 2015. The third season was filmed between July 15, 2015,
        and February 2, 2016. Filming for the fourth season commenced on 
        August 2, 2016, and concluded on January 18, 2017. Filming for 
        the fifth season commenced on August 14, 2017, and wrapped up on January

        Post-production work, including ADR recording for the series,
        was done at the Cherry Beach Sound recording studio.
         David J. Peterson, who created Dothraki and Valyrian for 
         Game of Thrones, developed the Trigedasleng language for 
         The Grounders. Jason Rothenberg said it was similar to Creole
          English.[38] The language is called "Trig" on the show. 
         After his constructed language work on Star-Crossed, Peterson was contacted
         by the producers of The 100 to create a language for the Grounders, 
          an evolution of English. In the setting, 97 years have passed since
         the apocalypse, which is a very short time for significant language 
         change.[40] Because of this, Peterson posited an accelerated evolution 
         in which the early Grounders used a cant specifically to obfuscate their 
         speech and to differentiate between friend or foe. Trigedasleng derives 
         from that cant and evolved over several short generations of survivors 
         of the apocalypse.
         On March 12, 2020, Warner Bros. Television shut down
         production on all of their shows due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
         however, writer Kim Shumway confirmed they were able to complete 
         filming for their seventh season.
